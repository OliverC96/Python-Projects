<h3> A Variety of Python-Based Projects </h3>
<ul>
  <li> These projects are largely the product of online programming bootcamps I have been taking on Udemy. </li>
  <li> They span multiple different categories of Python applications, including:
  <ul>
    <li> RESTful API's (utilizing third-party API's, as well as developing my own from scratch) </li>
    <li> Data analytics and machine learning models/algorithms (via pandas, numpy, seaborn, and sklearn) </li>
    <li> Web scraping and automation (via Beautiful Soup and Selenium) </li>
    <li> Web/server development (via Flask, wtforms, Bootstrap, and Heroku) </li>
    <li> Relational databases (SQLite via SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL) </li>
    <li> Simple GUI applications (via TKinter) </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
